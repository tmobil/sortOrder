Sort Order problem


Write a program that given a sorted dictionary of a foriegn language, find the sort order of characters. 

Example:
Input:  words[] = {"@!!", "!@#$", "!@#!", "#!@", "#!$"}
Output: Order of characters is '@', '$', '!', '#'

The words were sorted in the given language 
"@!!" comes before "!@#$"
Therefore '@' is before '!' in output.
Similarly we can find other orders.

Input:  words[] = {"#!!", "!!!", "!!@"}
Output: Order of characters is '#', '!', '@'

Feel free to be creative, considering options such as words of differing character lengths, memory and performance considerations for the project.
